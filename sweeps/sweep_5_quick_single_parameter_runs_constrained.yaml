# 5. This sweep is a single parameter run for all models currently available on weather.
# This is to get some quick results on how much the constraints are being respected. 
# A companion sweep will run the ERM counterparts.
# Choices: LR=0.01, dual init=1.0, constrain 0.5, based on previous sweeps on Reformer 10e.
